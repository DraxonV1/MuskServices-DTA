## Setup

### Manual (binary directly)

1. Download the binary for your OS from the latest release
2. Place it alongside `config.json` and `license.key`
3. Insert your key into `license.key`
4. Configure `mode` and `ip_rotation` in `config.json`
5. Run the binary

### Via CLI (muskdta launcher)

```
pip install muskdta
muskdta
```

The launcher detects your OS, downloads the correct binary, installs dependencies, and handles config setup. On every run it checks for updates and validates your environment before launching.

**CLI commands:**

```
muskdta                    launch (update check + config check + start)
muskdta update             force re-download latest binary for your OS
muskdta config             re-run config setup in terminal
muskdta config manual      open config.json in your system editor
muskdta config validate    strict config validation
muskdta mode set afk       quick mode switch (worker/private/afk)
muskdta extensions sync    sync extension folders into config
muskdta doctor             run diagnostics for environment/config
muskdta logs --lines 80    show recent launcher logs
muskdta auto-update on     enable automatic update checks on launch
muskdta auto-update off    disable automatic update checks
muskdta discord            open the Discord server
muskdta status             show binary, version, config state, data path
```
